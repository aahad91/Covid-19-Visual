The preprocessed data will be visualized using various interactive visualization techniques to have a broader overview of correlation amongst data which will help to deduce significant information.<br />
The visualization techniques that will be used are as follows:<br />
<li> Time oriented visualization technique</li> 

<ul><li>Multi-series Line chart (for multivariate data)</li>
 x-axis represents "days" and y-axis represents "cases". Graphical attribute (glyph) is a colour which denotes categories of cases (confirmed, recovered, death).</ul>


<li> Region-based technique</li>

<ul><li>Bar chart(3D)</li>
x-axis represents "age group" and y-axis represents "No. of cases".</ul>

<ul><li>Grouped Bar chart(3D) (for multivariate data)</li>
 x-axis represents "Counties" and y-axis represents "cases". Graphical attribute (glyph) is a colour which denotes categories of cases (confirmed, recovered, death).</ul>


<li> Multivariate data visualization technique</li>

<ul><li>Scatter plot</li>
 x-axis represents "age group" whereas y-axis represents "No. of cases".  Graphical attribute (glyph) is a colour which denotes gender (male, female).</ul>

<li> Multivariate data visualization technique</li>

<ul><li>Bubble chart</li>
 x-axis represents population and y-axis represents "No. of cases". Size of the bubble depends on the count of cases.</ul></ol>
